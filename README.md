Drupal 6 Themer Snippets
=================

This is the source code of my Drupal 6 Dreamweaver Snippets that can be found in http://danreb.com/content/drupal-6-themer-snippets-10-free-dreamweaver-extension-drupal-themer

This is for Dreamweaver CS4 and below and also tested working in Macromedia Dreamweaver 8. I decided to revive this extension and improve plus add support for Drupal 7 for the sake of all the developer that still use Macromedia 8 and Dreamweaver CS4 and below.

Although Dreamweaver CS5 and all the future version of Dreamweaver have now full support  for all leading content management system like Drupal, Joomla and Wordpress, I still believed that this extension still can and will be able to help users of Dreamweaver and Drupal to be able to work productively by using the snippets panel and by clicking a button provided by this extension that will automatically insert code specific for Drupal.

Will be making changes to this extension very very soon...
